                <p> Overall have had very strong experience. Wherever there has been a hiccup, it has turned out that the Donately technology was working fine, and it was a problem with a third party technology instead. Customer support has always been rapid and on point.</p>

                <p>would strongly recommend use of the Donately technology.</p>
